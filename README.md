## Overview

Ngyn is designed to make building web servers in Rust both enjoyable and productive. It combines ergonomic APIs with performance-focused design, making it suitable for everything from small APIs to large-scale web applications.

## Features

- **Intuitive Routing**: Simple, declarative routing patterns `(app.get(), /users/{id})` familiar to web developers
- **Flexible Middleware**: Asynchronous middleware system for request/response processing
- **Performance Focused**: Optimized for both development experience and runtime performance
- **Modern Rust**: Takes advantage of Rust's type system and async features
- **Optional Macros**: Enhance your route handlers with minimal boilerplate
- **Platform Agnostic**: Built to work with various HTTP servers (currently supports Hyper)

## Getting Started

Add ngyn to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ngyn = "0.5"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Create a basic web server:

```rust
use ngyn::prelude::*;

#[handler]
fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World!"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = HyperApplication::default();
    
    // Handle all routes and HTTP methods
    app.any("*", hello);
    
    println!("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080");
    let _ = app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080").await;
}
```

## Examples
