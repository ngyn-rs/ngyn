## Features

- Battle tested Ergonomic API. (You'll love writing routes in ngyn)
- Performance-balanced approaches
- Optional Macro API for enhancing route handlers
- Asynchronous access gates and middleware for handling requests and responses
- Optional Asynchronous routing support for defining routes

Please note that Ngyn is still in its early stages of development, and the API is subject to change.

## Example

This example demonstrates how to create a simple web server using Ngyn and [Hyper](https://hyper.rs) Platform.

```toml
[dependencies]
ngyn = { version = "0.5" }
```

And here's the code:

```rust ignore
use ngyn::prelude::*;

#[handler]
fn echo_hello() -> String {
    "Hello World!".to_string()
}


#[main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = HyperApplication::default();
    app.any("*", echo_hello); // handle all routes and http methods
    let _ = app.listen("127.0.0.1:8080").await;
}
```
