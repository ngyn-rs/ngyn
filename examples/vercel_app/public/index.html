    <h1 class="text-4xl mb-4">Welcome to Ngyn</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Ngyn is a progressive backend framework written in Rust. It's designed to
      be fast, reliable, and efficient, making it ideal for high-performance web
      applications.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl mb-2">Installation</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      To install Ngyn, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. Once you
      have Rust installed, you can install Ngyn using cargo:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cargo install ngyn</code></pre>
    <h2 class="text-3xl mb-2">Capabilities</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Ngyn can handle routing, middleware, and async interactions. It's designed
      to be extensible, allowing you to add your own functionality as needed.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl mb-2">Limitations</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      While Ngyn is powerful, it's not a silver bullet. It's not designed to
      handle frontend logic or user interface design. For those tasks, you'll
      need to use a frontend framework or library.
